# image-classifier
Creating a training a neural network to classify images of flowers for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course

# Overview
This repository contains the second project completed for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning online course. We were given a dataset of flower images and had to create and train a neural network that would be able to classify those images by species. I developed the model within a Jupyter notebook and then created two Python scripts in order to train the model and then use it to classify images at the command line.

# Requirements
This project uses the following python libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* pytorch and torchvision
* matplotlib
Jupyter notebook is also required.
